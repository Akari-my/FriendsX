# 🤝 Friendship behaviour
# If true, when a player removes a friend, the other side is also removed.
# Example:
#  - two-sided-friends: true  -> A removes B, B also loses A as friend
#  - two-sided-friends: false -> A removes B, but B still has A in their list
two-sided-friends: true

# 👥 Friend limit
# Maximum number of friends a player can have by default.
default-friend-limit: 50

# 🔐 Friend limits by permission
# You can override the default limit using permissions.
# Format:
#  friend-limits:
#    permission.node.here: limit
#
# Example:
#  friend-limits:
#    friendsx.limit.vip: 100
#    friendsx.limit.elite: 200
#
# If a player has multiple permissions, the HIGHEST limit is used.
